# Reserved (slot)

## Definition
A reserved slot for future expansion of Category 05. This file is intentionally a **placeholder**.

## Intent
- Hold an ID and filename for later insertion.
- Prevent renumbering churn in the library.

## Mechanism
- Keep structure aligned to baseline.
- Mark content as placeholder clearly.

## When to Use
- You anticipate adding a pattern later.
- You need stable numbering for cross-references.

## When Not to Use
- You are ready to define the real pattern.
- You want a minimal library without reserved slots.
