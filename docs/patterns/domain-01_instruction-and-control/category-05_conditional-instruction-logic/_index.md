# Conditional Instruction Logic

## Definition
A category of prompt patterns that encode **explicit conditional logic** (rules, branches, fallbacks) so outputs follow predictable decision paths.

## Included Patterns
- p01 — If–Then Instruction Patterns
- p02 — Branching Logic Instructions
- p03 — Exception & Edge Case Handling
- p04 — Fallback Behavior Directives
- p05 — Context-Dependent Instructions
- p06 — Preference-Based Condition Sets
- p07 — Reserved Slot

## Notes
Use these patterns when you need deterministic routing. Prefer explicit predicates and define defaults.
