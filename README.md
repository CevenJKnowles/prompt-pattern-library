# Prompt Pattern Library

Canonical prompt-pattern taxonomy and atomic pattern library.

## What this repo is
- **Taxonomy v1.0**: Domains → Categories → Subcategories (locked)

  > **Note:** Conceptually, the Prompt Pattern Library defines 18 primary domains; **Domain 19 (Meta-Prompting & System Control)** is included as a structural domain to materialize the meta-layer required for documentation, navigation, and tooling.

- **Phase 2**: One file per pattern (subcategory), using a consistent YAML + Markdown schema.
